It helps you catch bugs early by ensuring all of the components of your program work as expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: This guide is targeted towards &lt;em>experts&lt;/em> who have advanced knowledge of ComputerCraft and know a few things about unit tests.&lt;/strong>
Experience with unit tests in another language is helpful too, but isn&amp;rsquo;t required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://computercraft.cc">CC: Tweaked&lt;/a> contains a little-known unit testing framework called &lt;strong>McFly&lt;/strong>, which describes itself as &amp;ldquo;a very basic test framework for ComputerCraft&amp;rdquo; drawing inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/">Busted&lt;/a> framework for Lua.
This post will function as an introduction to McFly, in the process providing instructions for running the tests inside of the &lt;a href="https://craftos-pc.cc">CraftOS-PC emulator&lt;/a>, suitable for running in a continuous integration pipeline.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
