**Note 4 August 2025: I have since abandoned this system. I may or may not write another piece once I have solidified a new system. I would also like to expand on the "Please take inspiration, but don't use this" section at a later date.** I am leaving this up mostly for posterity.**

Hello! This is an abstract walkthrough of my PKM system that I use with Obsidian and Zotero.
This is largely a mash-up of different systems, designed to fit *my* needs.

## The name

In my mind, the system doesn't have a name, but I needed to name it *something* for this post, so I've decided on **PANoRAMA**.[^1]

Here's the folders:

* **P**rojects: Short-term efforts with a specific final outcome. [^2]
* **A**reas: Long-term commitments requiring management in order to uphold a standard. [^2]
* **No**tes: Long-term 'main' notes, to be used in my writing. [^3]
* **R**eferences: Notes taken during the act of reading. [^3]
* **A**rchive: Projects which are complete, irrelevant or obsolete areas, and fully processed reference notes. [^2]
* **M**eta: Templates mostly. I needed a place for this kind of stuff, and 'meta' sounded rather nice at the time.
* **A**ttachments: Images and diagrams used in any of the folders listed above.

Yes, this is a lot of folders, and each of them has a specific purpose and were only made after I determined a need for its existence.

## PARA-inspired: Projects, Areas, Archive

If you've read Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain, you most likely recognized these three folders.

The truth is, I ripped them from his system and placed them into my own, because they fit my needs.

Resources is excluded because it's already covered by References (see below).

## "Notes"? Isn't that a little broad?

Yeah, it is. Originally, my system only had a Notes folder and a References folder. I didn't want to change it, so I left it.

This folder is analogous to the 'main notes' of the Zettelkasten method.

## "References"?

The references folder is analogous to the 'literature notes' from the Zettelkasten method.

Each file inside of this folder is a Zotero bibkey. I annotate my sources in Zotero and import them here.

## The two oddballs: Meta and Attachments

Meta is a place for anything that my vault needs to function. Examples include templates, copies of configuration that I really don't want to have to invent twice, and so on.

Attachments is what it sounds like: Images. I only add an image to a note if I feel like it helps to explain a concept better.

## This system isn't all-encompassing

My system isn't an all-encompassing 'life OS'. Most notably, you'll notice there's no task management system or daily notes/journal system incorporated.

My [Bullet Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal) is my task management system and my place for journalling. I enjoy the feel of paper, and my Bullet Journal is always accessible, even when PANoRAMA is not. My Bullet Journal also has a slight air of serenity to it, which my Obsidian vault does not. The BuJo is a little order-making machine, and PANoRAMA is a system for processing information, which are two different tasks in my mind.

## Please take inspiration, but don't use this

This system has been battle-tested by myself for nearly a year. Emphasis on **myself**.
I don't intend this system to be used *in situ* inside of your Obsidian vault.
Instead, please *take inspiration* and build your system to fit your needs.
If our systems end up being identical, great! If not, also great! **As long as it works for you**.
